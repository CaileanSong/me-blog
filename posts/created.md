## reasons

I used Vue.js for a long time, but i want to try something new, so first i tried to use React.js, but i found that React.js is too complex, so i decided to use Next.js, which is a framework based on React.js, and it is very simple to use.

As a new of Next.js, i want to share my experience with you, and i hope it will be helpful to you.and also, i will continue to update this article, so please look forward to it.
