## About me
This is an inner monologue, unrelated to any technology. Before graduation, my understanding of technology was limited to its application level, and I pursued functionality over everything else, paying little attention to or understanding the underlying concepts. It can also be called laziness. I always feel like I've been like this, full of energy at the beginning, but always ending up with a bad ending. Sometimes, we anticipate failure before it even begins. For example, blogging has been delayed for a long time, and it is only just beginning now. I am confused about open source and don't know how to submit issues or when to submit them. Maybe my friend [elonehoo](https://github.com/elonehoo) is right, I am not suitable for developing this circle. How can I say? I have to hold on now. Although I don't know what the motivation is, at least I have my own blog, right. It's a message to my future self, recorded in my past.
